AWS
Check if SECRET_KEY is needed in config.py and if it's safe

BUGS
Uploads directory should be cleared after 24 hours - AWS Cloudwatch + Lambda?
Going back in text doesn't work once text has been degendered

NAMES & PRONOUNS



HTML / CSS
Figure out why the text is more centered in pronouns and known names


CLEANUP
Remove debugging print calls and console.logs
Document code (with ChatGPT?)
Remove before_request cookie size checker

DEGENDERING FEATURES


OTHER IMPROVEMENTS
Session cookies get pretty large - Might be better to save more data locally


DEGENDERING HTML CONTENT




DEGENDERING IMPROVEMENTS
It should be possible to create samples from text degendering so that people
can create examples for copyrighted books


EXTRAS
Validate the process_epub function - replace first part with epub validation
	     		  	  	 	 pip install epubcheck



DONE - Going back and clearing a name correspondence should actually clear it

DONE - Track download count of samples
DONE - Session cookie too big - 5k max?
      SOLUTION - This was because of all sample data being inside session cookie
DONE - Samples should not repeat before all have been displayed
     Reworked samples with fixed random order, more and previous pages
